So, let's see. We have a frog on the screen. 
Can you please rise your hands, who think this frog is poisonous?

Good. In fact, it is a poisonous dart frog. Toxin from one of those can kill 10 people.
But have you ever thought, why aren't this toxin kill the frog itself?

This is what I want to talk about. My name is Bondarev Michael. And, hello everyone!

#### Intro

My talk should last for 5 minutes, and I would be grateful if you leave your questions till the end
of my presentation.

For the starters, I will tell you about the poison itself and how it works. Then I'll give you a rough idea
on how frogs become invulnerable to this poison. And in the end I'll describe some consequences of the 
chemistry in this frogs.

#### Poison

So, let's get started. The toxin we are discussing is a chemical compound called 'epibatidine'. 
Though it's a powerful toxin, frogs use it as a defense mechanism. It's contained in their skin, and is 
made of toxic components of their food. 

When predator consumes this toxin, it affects neurons, or, more precisely, special proteins in neurons.
They link together, and protein becomes inactive. So no information can pass the affected neurons.

I've prepared some illustrations for this process, so it would be harder to understand. _(joke, maybe I's scratch that)_

By the way, this frogs are called 'dart frogs', because Amazon hunters used to use this poison on the tip of
their darts in hunting.

#### Amino-acid

To gain protection, frogs modified the vulnerable protein. Proteins are made from amino-acids, and frogs
just replaced one of acids. This didn't change the protein, but modified its shape, so toxin can't attach
to it.

Sounds good, though there were side effects to this change. Here it is.
The messages from nerves to tissues are carried by acetylcoline. After the shape changed, this messenger 
can't attach to protein for the same reason as toxin.

#### Additional changes

To solve this issue, frogs replaced some more amino-acids, and changed protein's shape a bit more. But much 
less then on previous step. After this, the functionality of messenger was restored, without loosing 
protection form toxin.

The interesting thing is that different species found completely different ways to make this adjustments.
Scientist found at least 3 different approaches for the task.

#### Conclusion

This brings me to the end of my presentation. I tell you about frogs self-defense mechanisms, and 
how it doesn't harm this frogs. 
I don't think you started to love frogs more than usual after this. For example, Terry Pratchett wrote:

"If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are.
Style. That's what people remember."

Now you can argue with that: at least cats aren't poisonous. And to cheer you up a bit after this talk,
here are some cats for you.

Thank you for your attention.
